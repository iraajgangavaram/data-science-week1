WEEK 2 CLEANING PLAN
====================
Name: [Iraaj Gangavaram]
Date: [30 January 2026]

I've completed all 5 tutorials and application checklists.

Looking across all my checklists, these are the 2 most important issues 
to address in Week 2:


ISSUE 1 (Most Important)
-------------------------
Brief description: [Strings (categories): Are there inconsistent spellings/capitalisation/whitespace 
in categorical variables like species, island, sex, or clutch_completion 
that would create duplicate levels (e.g., "MALE" vs "male" vs "MALE ")? ]

Which tutorial provides the solution: [Tutorial 1]

Which variable(s) affected: [ species]

Why this is important to fix: [ This is important to fix because if it isnt fixed then there would be inconsistencies in the spellings 
which would affect the way the data looks.]

What I plan to do: [ Run code to fix the inconsistent spellings]



ISSUE 2 (Second Most Important)
--------------------------------
Brief description: [Is date_egg consistently stored as DD/MM/YYYY, and does converting it with lubridate::dmy() 
produce any parsing warnings or NAs that suggest inconsistent date entry?]

Which tutorial provides the solution: [Tutorial 2]

Which variable(s) affected: [date_gg]

Why this is important to fix: [There could be errors in interpreting the dates which could lead to errors in data analysis
performed about it.]

What I plan to do: [Run code to standardise all the dates.]



OTHER ISSUES I NOTICED (but won't fix in Week 2)
-------------------------------------------------
- Which variables have the most missing values (e.g., delta_15n, delta_13c, sex, and the morphology measures), and 
how does missingness affect grouped summaries like mean(body_mass_g) by species when na.rm=FALSE vs na.rm=TRUE?

QUESTIONS TO DISCUSS IN WEEK 2
-------------------------------
Things I'm still unsure about:

1. Numeric validity of body mass measurements

2. 

3.
