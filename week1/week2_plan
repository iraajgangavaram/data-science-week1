WEEK 2 CLEANING PLAN
====================
Name: [Iraaj Gangavaram]
Date: [30 January 2026]

I've completed all 5 tutorials and application checklists.

Looking across all my checklists, these are the 2 most important issues 
to address in Week 2:


ISSUE 1 (Most Important)
-------------------------
Brief description: [Strings (categories): Are there inconsistent spellings/capitalisation/whitespace 
in categorical variables like species, island, sex, or clutch_completion 
that would create duplicate levels (e.g., "MALE" vs "male" vs "MALE ")? ]

Which tutorial provides the solution: [Tutorial 1]

Which variable(s) affected: [ species]

Why this is important to fix: [ This is important to fix because if it isnt fixed then there would be inconsistencies in the spellings 
which would affect the way the data looks.]

What I plan to do: [ Run code to fix the inconsistent spellings]



ISSUE 2 (Second Most Important)
--------------------------------
Brief description: [Is date_egg consistently stored as DD/MM/YYYY, and does converting it with lubridate::dmy() 
produce any parsing warnings or NAs that suggest inconsistent date entry?]

Which tutorial provides the solution: [Tutorial 2]

Which variable(s) affected: [date_gg]

Why this is important to fix: [There could be errors in interpreting the dates which could lead to errors in data analysis
performed about it.]

What I plan to do: [Run code to standardise all the dates.]



OTHER ISSUES I NOTICED (but won't fix in Week 2)
-------------------------------------------------
- Which variables have the most missing values (e.g., delta_15n, delta_13c, sex, and the morphology measures), and 
how does missingness affect grouped summaries like mean(body_mass_g) by species when na.rm=FALSE vs na.rm=TRUE?

QUESTIONS TO DISCUSS IN WEEK 2
-------------------------------
Things I'm still unsure about:

1. Numeric validity of body mass measurements

2. 

3.
 ISSUE 3 (Most Important)
-------------------------
Brief description: [Some variables have different characters for the same distinct characteristic]

Which tutorial provides the solution: [strings]

Which variable(s) affected: [Site, collector, treatment]

Why this is important to fix: [With different characters, variables of the same type wont be grouped, which will make it hard to compare between different factors]

What I plan to do: [Find all factors with similar characters that suggest they should be part of the same group, then change the names of all by one, so they are all seen as part of that same group when analysing the data]



ISSUE 4 (Second Most Important)
--------------------------------
Brief description: [There are multiple duplications of data within the dataset]

Which tutorial provides the solution: [duplicates]

Which variable(s) affected: [duplication of entire rows]

Why this is important to fix: [duplciates do the same data will change the mean and median, skewing the dataset]

What I plan to do: [ Simply remove the duplicate rows. Also, to be sure I'll check for less obvious duplicates within the data, where there are identical values for the majority of the varaibles]



OTHER ISSUES I NOTICED (but won't fix in Week 2)
-------------------------------------------------
- [Issue 3 - there are many inconsistencies]
- [Issue 4 - uncertain how to handle]
- [Issue 5 - decided to leave as-is because...]
