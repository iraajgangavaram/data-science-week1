WEEK 2 CLEANING PLAN
====================
Name: [Iraaj Gangavaram]
Date: [30 January 2026]

I've completed all 5 tutorials and application checklists.

Looking across all my checklists, these are the 2 most important issues 
to address in Week 2:


ISSUE 1 (Most Important)
-------------------------
Brief description: [Consistency between egg production and egg hatching]

Which tutorial provides the solution: [Tutorial 5]

Which variable(s) affected: [eggs_laid, eggs_hatched]

Why this is important to fix: [Number of eggs hatched cannot be greater than number of eggs laid.]

What I plan to do: [Check for inconsistencies in the data, and make the errors into null values.]



ISSUE 2 (Second Most Important)
--------------------------------
Brief description: [Numeric validity of body mass measurements]

Which tutorial provides the solution: [Tutorial 5]

Which variable(s) affected: [body_mass_mg]

Why this is important to fix: [The body mass of a mosquito cant be negative.]

What I plan to do: [Make the negative values into null values.]



OTHER ISSUES I NOTICED (but won't fix in Week 2)
-------------------------------------------------
- [capitalisation of treatment descriptions is not consistent]
- [Numeric validity of body mass measurements - uncertain how to handle]
- [Are all collection dates consistently formatted - decided to leave as-is because collection dates look like they are correctly formatted.]


QUESTIONS TO DISCUSS IN WEEK 2
-------------------------------
Things I'm still unsure about:

1. Numeric validity of body mass measurements

2. 

3.
