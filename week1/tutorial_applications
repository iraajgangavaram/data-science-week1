TUTORIAL 1: CHECKING STRINGS - APPLICATION CHECKLIST
================================================================================

[ done ] I completed the tutorial exercises


CONNECTING TO MY DATA:
----------------------

1. Did I identify any string-related questions in my Week 1 questions list?

   [ x] YES - Question #(s): ____why is the capitalisation of treatment descriptions not consistent?_______
   [ ] NO - Skip to question 4


2. If YES, which technique from this tutorial could help address my question?

   [x ] str_to_lower() - standardize capitalization
   [ ] str_to_upper() - standardize capitalization  
   [x ] str_trim() - remove leading/trailing whitespace
   [ x] str_replace() - fix typos or inconsistent spellings
   [ ] Other: ___________
   [ ] None of these apply.


3. Show what this technique would DO to my data:

   Variable name: ___species________
   
   Example values BEFORE:
   - Adelie 
   - adelie
   - Adelie
   What they would become AFTER:
   - adelie
   - adelie
   - adelie


4. If this tutorial is NOT relevant to my data:

   Why not? (Check all that apply)
   [ ] I don't have any character/text variables
   [ ] My text variables are already clean
   [ ] My string issues are different from what this tutorial covers
   [ ] Other: ___________

TUTORIAL 2: CHECKING DATES - APPLICATION CHECKLIST
================================================================================

[x ] I completed the tutorial exercises



CONNECTING TO MY DATA:
----------------------

1. Did I identify any date-related questions in my Week 1 questions list?

   [ x] YES - Question #(s): ___Are all collection dates consistently formatted?________
   [ ] NO - Skip to question 5


2. If YES, which technique from this tutorial could help address my question?

   [ x] dmy() / ymd() / mdy() - parse dates in different formats
   [ ] excel_numeric_to_date() - convert Excel serial numbers
   [ ] Checking for impossible dates (wrong day/month/year)
   [ ] Other: ___________
   [ ] None of these apply


3. Show what this technique would DO to my data:

   Variable name: _____date_gg______
   
   Example values BEFORE:
   - 16/11/2007
  - 01/12/2009
   -23/11/2008
   
   What they would become AFTER:
   - 2007-11-16
   - 2009-12-01
   - 2008-11-23


4. Think about consequences:

   What assumption am I making about date format?
   (e.g., "01/12/2023 is DD/MM/YYYY not MM/DD/YYYY")
  assuming that date_egg is recorded using DD/MM/YYYY which assumes that 01 is the day, 
  december is the month and the year is 2023.
   
   What could go wrong if this assumption is incorrect?
   The day and month values can be switched if the assumption is wrong. This could lead to data analysis errors.
   How could I verify my assumption is correct?
   
5. If this tutorial is NOT relevant to my data:

   Why not?
   [ ] I don't have any date variables
   [ ] My dates are already in proper format
   [ ] My date issues are different from what this tutorial covers
   [ ] Other: ____Not applicable because the tutorial is relevant._______

TUTORIAL 3: CHECKING MISSING DATA PATTERNS - APPLICATION CHECKLIST
================================================================================

[ x ] I completed the tutorial exercises


CONNECTING TO MY DATA:
----------------------

1. Did I identify any missing data questions in my Week 1 questions list?

   [ x] YES - Question #(s): ____Why are there null values in the dataset?_______
   [ ] NO - But I'll check anyway (missing data is common)


2. Which variables have the most missing data?

   Variable: _____delta_15n______ | Percent missing: _~4____%
   Variable: _____delta_13c______ | Percent missing: __~4___%
   Variable: ____sex_______ | Percent missing: __<1___%


3. Missingness types checklist


   [ ] MCAR (Missing Completely At Random) - appears random/scattered
   [x ] MAR (Missing At Random) - related to other observed variables
   [ ] MNAR (Missing Not At Random) - related to the missing value itself

Why is it important to know what type of missing data we have? 
It is because the missingness mechanism affects bias the cleaning strategy stands true.

TUTORIAL 4: CHECKING DUPLICATES - APPLICATION CHECKLIST
================================================================================

[x ] I completed the tutorial exercises


CONNECTING TO MY DATA:
----------------------

1. Did I identify any duplicate-related questions in my Week 1 questions list?

   [ x] YES - Question #(s): ___________
   [ ] NO - But I'll check anyway


3. Think about consequences:

   If I remove duplicates, what am I assuming?
   I am assuming that duplicate rows represent accidental repeeated records rather than true biological obersvations. 
   removing them assumes each penguin measurement should only appear once in the dataset.
   
   If duplicates are actually repeated measures, what should I do instead?
   [ ] Keep them - they're legitimate observations
   [ x] Flag them for later analysis that accounts for non-independence
   [ ] Other: ___________

TUTORIAL 5: NUMERIC & CROSS-VARIABLE CONSISTENCY - APPLICATION CHECKLIST
================================================================================

[ x ] I completed the tutorial exercises


PART A: NUMERIC PLAUSIBILITY
-----------------------------

1. Did I identify any numeric plausibility questions in my Week 1 questions list?

   [x ] YES - Question #(s): ____6_______
   [ ] NO - Skip to Part B


2. If YES, which numeric variable looks suspicious?

   Variable name: ____body_mass_g_______
   
   Minimum value: __2700___  | Is this biologically possible? [ ] Yes [x ] No [ ] Unsure
   Maximum value: ___6300__  | Is this biologically possible? [ ] Yes [x ] No [ ] Unsure[.]
   

   Why do these look wrong?
   [ ] Negative value (impossible for this measurement)
   [ ] Zero (should be NA instead)
   [x ] Too large (exceeds known biological maximum)
   [ x] Too small (below known biological minimum)
   [ ] Possible units confusion (mixed kg and g?)
   [ ] Other: ___________



PART B: CROSS-VARIABLE CONSISTENCY
-----------------------------------

4. Did I identify any cross-variable questions in my Week 1 questions list?

   [ x] YES - Question #(s): _____Consistency between egg production and egg hatching______
   [ ] NO - But I'll check anyway


5. Choose TWO variables that should be related (e.g., body length and body mass,
   sex and reproductive status, species and location):

   Variable 1: ___flipper_length_mm________
   Variable 2: ____body_mass_g_______
   
   What relationship do I expect between them?
   [x ] Positive correlation (both increase together)
   [ ] Negative correlation (one increases, other decreases)
   [ ] Biological constraint (certain combinations impossible)
   [ ] Spatial constraint (certain combinations shouldn't occur)
   [ ] Other: ___________
   
   Describe the expected relationship:
   penguins with larger flipper length should generally have body mass.
  some datapoints have high body mass and short flipper length.
6. Think about consequences:

   If these variables are inconsistent, what should I do?
   [ ] Remove the observations
   [ ] Convert one variable to NA (which one? _________)
   [x ] Flag for review but keep both
   [ ] Query the data collector
   [ x] Other: ___________
   
   Justification:
   the basic ranges look plausible. however a small number of records are species- or
   relationship unusual.
