TUTORIAL 1: CHECKING STRINGS - APPLICATION CHECKLIST
================================================================================

[ done ] I completed the tutorial exercises


CONNECTING TO MY DATA:
----------------------

1. Did I identify any string-related questions in my Week 1 questions list?

   [ this one] YES - Question #(s): ____why is the capitalisation of treatment descriptions not consistent?_______
   [ ] NO - Skip to question 4


2. If YES, which technique from this tutorial could help address my question?

   [ ] str_to_lower() - standardize capitalization
   [ this one ] str_to_upper() - standardize capitalization  
   [ ] str_trim() - remove leading/trailing whitespace
   [ ] str_replace() - fix typos or inconsistent spellings
   [ ] Other: ___________
   [ ] None of these apply.


3. Show what this technique would DO to my data:

   Variable name: ___treatment________
   
   Example values BEFORE:
   - high_dose
   - medium_dose
   - 
   
   What they would become AFTER:
   - High_dose
   - Medium_dose
   - 


4. If this tutorial is NOT relevant to my data:

   Why not? (Check all that apply)
   [ ] I don't have any character/text variables
   [ ] My text variables are already clean
   [ ] My string issues are different from what this tutorial covers
   [ ] Other: ___________

TUTORIAL 2: CHECKING DATES - APPLICATION CHECKLIST
================================================================================

[ done ] I completed the tutorial exercises



CONNECTING TO MY DATA:
----------------------

1. Did I identify any date-related questions in my Week 1 questions list?

   [this one ] YES - Question #(s): ___Are all collection dates consistently formatted?________
   [ ] NO - Skip to question 5


2. If YES, which technique from this tutorial could help address my question?

   [ this one] dmy() / ymd() / mdy() - parse dates in different formats
   [ ] excel_numeric_to_date() - convert Excel serial numbers
   [ this one] Checking for impossible dates (wrong day/month/year)
   [ ] Other: ___________
   [ ] None of these apply


3. Show what this technique would DO to my data:

   Variable name: ___collection_date________
   
   Example values BEFORE:
   - 2023-05-23

   - 2023-08-27

  - 2024-01-15
   
   
   What they would become AFTER:
   - No change, dates are correctly formatted.
   - 
   - 


4. Think about consequences:

   What assumption am I making about date format?
   (e.g., "01/12/2023 is DD/MM/YYYY not MM/DD/YYYY")
   The assumption is that the date format is DD/MM/YYYY
   
   What could go wrong if this assumption is incorrect?
   If the assumption is incorrect it could lead to errors in data handling, statistics about the data and leading to incorrect ordering of samples.
   
   How could I verify my assumption is correct?
   Check that all months are ≤ 12 and days ≤ 31. Compare dates across related variables.

5. If this tutorial is NOT relevant to my data:

   Why not?
   [ ] I don't have any date variables
   [ ] My dates are already in proper format
   [ ] My date issues are different from what this tutorial covers
   [this one ] Other: ____Not applicable because the tutorial is relevant._______

TUTORIAL 3: CHECKING MISSING DATA PATTERNS - APPLICATION CHECKLIST
================================================================================

[ done ] I completed the tutorial exercises


CONNECTING TO MY DATA:
----------------------

1. Did I identify any missing data questions in my Week 1 questions list?

   [this one ] YES - Question #(s): ____Why are there null values in the dataset?_______
   [ ] NO - But I'll check anyway (missing data is common)


2. Which variables have the most missing data?

   Variable: ______eggs hatched_____ | Percent missing: _7.8____%
   Variable: ____eggs laid_______ | Percent missing: ___7.8%__%
   Variable: ___________ | Percent missing: _____%


3. Missingness types checklist


   [ this one] MCAR (Missing Completely At Random) - appears random/scattered
   [ ] MAR (Missing At Random) - related to other observed variables
   [ ] MNAR (Missing Not At Random) - related to the missing value itself

Why is it important to know what type of missing data we have? 
It is important to know what type of missing data we have because it can directly affect the conculusions and statistics we draw from the data.

TUTORIAL 4: CHECKING DUPLICATES - APPLICATION CHECKLIST
================================================================================

[done ] I completed the tutorial exercises


CONNECTING TO MY DATA:
----------------------

1. Did I identify any duplicate-related questions in my Week 1 questions list?

   [ ] YES - Question #(s): ___________
   [ this one] NO - But I'll check anyway


3. Think about consequences:

   If I remove duplicates, what am I assuming?
   If duplicates are removed, the assumption is made that none of the data repeated as it is.
   
   If duplicates are actually repeated measures, what should I do instead?
   [ this one] Keep them - they're legitimate observations
   [ ] Flag them for later analysis that accounts for non-independence
   [ ] Other: ___________

TUTORIAL 5: NUMERIC & CROSS-VARIABLE CONSISTENCY - APPLICATION CHECKLIST
================================================================================

[ done ] I completed the tutorial exercises


PART A: NUMERIC PLAUSIBILITY
-----------------------------

1. Did I identify any numeric plausibility questions in my Week 1 questions list?

   [this one ] YES - Question #(s): ____Numeric validity of body mass measurements_______
   [ ] NO - Skip to Part B


2. If YES, which numeric variable looks suspicious?

   Variable name: ___body_mass_mg________
   
   Minimum value: __-87 mg___  | Is this biologically possible? [ ] Yes [ ] No [. ] Unsure
   Maximum value: _109 mg____  | Is this biologically possible? [ ] Yes [ ] No [ ] Unsure[.]
   

   Why do these look wrong?
   [ this one] Negative value (impossible for this measurement)
   [ ] Zero (should be NA instead)
   [ ] Too large (exceeds known biological maximum)
   [ ] Too small (below known biological minimum)
   [ ] Possible units confusion (mixed kg and g?)
   [ ] Other: ___________



PART B: CROSS-VARIABLE CONSISTENCY
-----------------------------------

4. Did I identify any cross-variable questions in my Week 1 questions list?

   [ this one] YES - Question #(s): _____Consistency between egg production and egg hatching______
   [ ] NO - But I'll check anyway


5. Choose TWO variables that should be related (e.g., body length and body mass,
   sex and reproductive status, species and location):

   Variable 1: ___eggs_laid________
   Variable 2: ____eggs_hatched_______
   
   What relationship do I expect between them?
   [ ] Positive correlation (both increase together)
   [ ] Negative correlation (one increases, other decreases)
   [ this one] Biological constraint (certain combinations impossible)
   [ ] Spatial constraint (certain combinations shouldn't occur)
   [ ] Other: ___________
   
   Describe the expected relationship:
   The number of eggs hatched cannot exceed the number of eggs laid. If eggs_laid = 0, then eggs_hatched must also be 0. Any violation indicates a data inconsistency or recording error.


6. Think about consequences:

   If these variables are inconsistent, what should I do?
   [ ] Remove the observations
   [ this one] Convert one variable to NA (which one? _________)
   [ this one] Flag for review but keep both
   [ ] Query the data collector
   [ ] Other: ___________
   
   Justification:
   Eggs hatching without eggs being laid is biologically impossible, suggesting an error in eggs_laid or eggs_hatched. the inconsistent value should be set to NA and the record flagged rather than removed, preserving the rest of the biological information.
